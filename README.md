Spring Cloud Config Server is a project that lets you set up a configuration server with minimal effort. 
Itâ€™s a standard Spring Boot application with specific properties that enable the configuration server functionality and the Git repository as the con- figuration data backend. The Polar Bookshop system will use this server to provide configuration to the Catalog Service application.
